Use fft audio info in a shader to create 'Visulisations'

- fftParameter holds float array of all channels (similar to perlin data)

- each channel has a spectrum array (spectrum[32])

- get average of L & R channels to make one array (may want to normalise too)

- use the height of each value to create "bars" for equaliser

Use this for creating a 1D texture with the fft data.
	glTexImage1D(GL_TEXTURE_1D, 0, GL_R32F, bufferwidth, 0, GL_RED, GL_FLOAT, data);
	
Then use this to update image rather than creating a new one every frame.
	glTexSubImage1D();
